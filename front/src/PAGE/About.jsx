              <p>My journey into development began during my engineering days, where a front-end project introduced me to the world of web technologies. That early spark turned into a deep passion, and after graduation, I transitioned fully into software development.

<br></br><br></br>Over the past few years, I've been building full-stack applications using the MERN stack, focusing on performance, scalability, and real-time capabilities. I also bring <strong style={{fontWeight:'700'}}>2 years of freelance experience</strong> , where Iâ€™ve collaborated individuals to deliver robust, user-focused web solutions.
<br></br><br></br>

I specialize in REST APIs, JWT-based authentication, MongoDB Atlas, Socket.IO for real-time communication, and AI integrations that bring intelligent functionality to modern applications.

What drives me is solving real problems with clean, scalable code. I believe great software should be simple, functional, and built to grow. developed products that impact thousands of users. </p>
